Did initial updates for closure... please have a look.... few issues are there... not sure which side...
1. GET for member_complete_data is having null memberName.
2. getting 500 error in getting member txs_to_close...
got this {"error":{"message":"Bad Input Request Exception: Account status Not 'Approved' it is : Active","reference":null}}
Inputs required:
1. How to get member's actual fund plan / EMI breakdown to display while closure?

>>>
currently I m calling get on member complete data to get member reg detail and his loan account detail....
this object doesn't have 'displayNames'.... currently I m using display names from app tracking object (response of '/group/v1/group_applications/').
Should I hard code these display names reuired in header of table in case of closure page.?

....
I was talking abt group rules ki mene update nahi kiye hai... wo toh kar diye the... just checked... 
Kuchh aur exceptions aya tha I thought ki becoz of this.
Closure page almost in place...all changes are committed.
Only minor updates are required to make it work.
